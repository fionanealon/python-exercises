 Exerise 1

Please complete the following exercise this week. In the video lectures this week we ran an example program that calculated the 30th Fibonacci number. Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. Once you calculate the right Fibonacci number for your own name, please post it to the Discussions forum on this page as per my post there.

T## Answer to Exercise 1
My name is Fiona, so the first and last letter of my name (F + A = 6 + 1) give the numberÂ 7. The 7th Fibonacci number is 13.

## Python code used to run this program

Adapted from https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/python-fib/blob/master/fib.py

- Ian McLoughlin

- A program that displays Fibonacci numbers.

def fib(n):
i
  """This function returns the nth Fibonacci number."""

  i = 0

  j = 1

  n = n - 1



  while n >= 0:

    i, j = j, i + j

    n = n - 1

  

  return i



Test the function with the following value.

x = 7

ans = fib(x)

print("Fibonacci number", x, "is", ans)

# Analysis

The above program displays the Fibonacci number of n where n is the 7th Fibonacci number in the sequence. A Fibonacci number sequence is  a sequence of numbers where the first two Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. The next Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous 2 Fibonacci numbers.

The 7th Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci number sequence = 13 (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13)

In creating a Python program to calculate the 7th Fibonacci number, we must first choose the variables for the program. The variables for this program are i = 0 and j = 1 where i and j are the first two Fibonacci numbers in the sequence and are the basis from which all future Fibonacci numbers are caluclated.

The second item that is required is a While Loop Statement. A While Loop Statement repeatedly executes a statement as long as a given condition is true.
